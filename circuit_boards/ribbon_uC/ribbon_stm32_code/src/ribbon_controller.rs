/// The position of the user's finger on the ribbon is represented as a number. The farther to the right the user is
/// pressing the larger the number. The position value is retained even when the user lifts their finger off of the
/// ribbon, similar to a sample-and-hold system. Some averaging is done to smooth out the raw readings and reduce the
/// influence of spurious inputs.
///

/// high (true) when the ribbon is being pressed and low (false) when no one is touching the ribbon.

/// The position value and gate signals are then typically used as control signals for other modules, such as
/// oscillators, filters, and amplifiers.
